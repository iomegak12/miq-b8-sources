      "The image illustrates the trends in the U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates and existing home sales from 2014 to 2023. Here are some insights:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mortgage Rate Trends**:\n",
      "   - The mortgage rates have generally fluctuated between 3% and 5% from 2014 to 2020.\n",
      "   - There was a significant drop in rates around 2020, likely due to economic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "   - Since 2021, mortgage rates have surged, reaching their highest level in over 20 years by 2023, exceeding 7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Existing Home Sales Trends**:\n",
      "   - Home sales have shown variability, with peaks and troughs throughout the period.\n",
      "   - There was a sharp increase in home sales around 2020, coinciding with the drop in mortgage rates.\n",
      "   - Since 2021, home sales have declined significantly, reaching their lowest levels in the observed period by 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Current Market Conditions (2023)**:\n",
      "   - The combination of high mortgage rates, rising home prices, and constrained housing inventory has led to the lowest housing affordability since 1989.\n",
      "   - The inverse relationship between mortgage rates and home sales is evident, as rising rates have contributed to declining sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the data suggests that the recent surge in mortgage rates has had a dampening effect on existing home sales, impacting housing affordability.\n"
